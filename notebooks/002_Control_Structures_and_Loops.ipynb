        "    - Do I still have milk at home?  \n",
        "    - Do I have time to grab a coffee before class starts?   \n",

        "\n",
        "- In Python, this kind of decision-making is handled using **control structures**. They let your program follow different paths and run different chunks of code depending on the situation. The simplest one is the `if` statement.  \n",

        "- Here’s the breakdown:  \n",
        "  - `if`: runs a block of code if a condition evaluates to `True`.  \n",
